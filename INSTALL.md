# Installing memory by hand

The agent can do all of this for you. Say "set up memory" in a session and
it holds a short conversation, then runs the commands. This document is for
the case where you want to run them yourself, or where you are writing a
bootstrap script for a new agent repository.

## Where to run the commands

Every command needs a repository, including the per-machine ones. `main()`
calls `set_root(project_root())` before it dispatches any subcommand, and
`project_root()` stops with "not inside a git repository and
CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is unset". So run `git init` on the target repository
first if it is new, then run everything below from inside it. Both of
these work:

- A Claude Code session opened in the target repository. The plugin puts
  `memory` on PATH while it is enabled.
- A terminal with the working directory inside the target repository. The
  command is at
  `~/.claude/plugins/cache/dokidlc/memory/<commit>/bin/memory`.

## Per machine, once

### 1. Check the prerequisites

Claude Code 2.1.195 or later, `uv` on PATH, and git. `memory doctor` exits
1 at the first check without `uv`.

### 2. Add the marketplace and install the plugin

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add git@github.com:daftdoki/dokidlc-plugins.git
claude plugin install memory@dokidlc
```

Use the full `git@` URL, not the `daftdoki/dokidlc-plugins` shorthand.
dokidlc-plugins is private. The shorthand clones over SSH and fails with
"No ED25519 host key is known for github.com" on a machine with no
`known_hosts` file, which is the normal state of a fresh container. The
shorthand is fine on a machine that already has github.com in
`known_hosts`.

### 3. Choose the search mode

```sh
memory setup --local                      # ollama on this machine
memory setup --host http://frame:11434    # ollama on another host
memory setup --substring                  # no ollama available
```

Pass a flag. `cmd_setup` in `bin/memory` calls `sys.stdin.isatty()` and
stops with "not a terminal" when it gets neither flags nor a tty. The
Claude Code Bash tool gives it no tty, so the interactive prompts only
work from a real terminal. The answer goes to
`~/.config/dokidlc-memory/config.toml`.

### 4. Install the dependencies

```sh
memory doctor --fix
```

This installs memoryfield-tool from the commit in `memory.pin`, with an
overrides file that drops `pysqlite3-binary`. That package ships a Linux
x86_64 wheel only, and the tool falls back to stdlib sqlite3 without it.
See `install_tool()` in `bin/memory`. On macOS, when the embedding host is
local and does not answer, `--fix` also runs `brew install ollama` and
`brew services start ollama`, then pulls `nomic-embed-text`. On Linux it
prints the one ollama command to run.

Doctor exits 1 here, and that is expected. The repository has no `.memory/`
yet, so the field, CLAUDE.md, and persistence rows report FAIL. Only four
rows must read `ok` at this point: `uv on PATH`, `memoryfield-tool`,
`embedding host`, and `model nomic-embed-text`. The rest turn green at step
9.

## Per repository

### 5. Make it a git repository

Run `git init` if it is new, and add a `.gitignore`. Ignore Python caches
and editor clutter. Do not ignore `.memory/`. `git_checks()` reports an
ignored `.memory/` as a persistence failure.

### 6. Create the field

```sh
memory init
```

This creates `.memory/index.md` from the template, appends the
`## Memory <!-- memory -->` section to `CLAUDE.md`, and runs `git add` on
both. Do not edit inside that marked section. `cmd_init` rewrites it
whenever the plugin's text moves on. The top half of `index.md` is yours.
The half below `<!-- generated below -->` is regenerated after every write.

### 7. Declare the plugin in project settings

Write `.claude/settings.json` by hand:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "dokidlc": { "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "daftdoki/dokidlc-plugins" } }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": { "memory@dokidlc": true }
}
```

`claude plugin install memory@dokidlc -s project` writes only
`enabledPlugins`. It leaves out `extraKnownMarketplaces` when this machine
already knows the marketplace, and then the file resolves nowhere on a
clone.

### 8. Commit the three paths

```sh
git add .memory .claude/settings.json CLAUDE.md && git commit
```

These three are the `PERSISTED` tuple in `bin/memory`. Doctor checks that
each one is tracked. Memory only survives a clone if they are committed.

### 9. Confirm

```sh
memory doctor
```

Every row should read `ok`, including "field validates". The last line
names the index cache directory. That cache is derived, never committed,
and `memory index` rebuilds it.

## What project settings do not do

Settings declare intent. They install nothing. Someone who clones the new
repository on another machine still needs steps 1 to 4 before `memory` is
on PATH. Put those commands in the repository's own bootstrap script if the
agent runs in a container.
