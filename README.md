# dokidlc-skill-memory

A Claude Code plugin that keeps what your agent learns in the repository, searchable by meaning.

It installs as `memory@dokidlc`. Pages are markdown files in `.memory/` in
the [memoryfield](https://github.com/calpaterson/memoryfield-spec) format,
so they travel with the code in git and any memoryfield tool can read
them. Three parts: the `memory` command, which wraps
[memoryfield-tool](https://github.com/calpaterson/memoryfield-tool) with
per-repository configuration, a guard on the embedding host, and a trust
model; seven hooks that put the matching page in front of the agent as it
works; and a skill that says when to search, when to write, and what to
do with a page found wrong.

With it enabled, the agent works memory on its own. Every prompt you send
is searched, and when pages match, one line names them with the command to
read each; a shell command that fails is searched with its error text. The
agent writes a page when something took more than one attempt. A page
cites files at a commit, so when a cited file changes, search marks the
page suspect and the agent reads the diff, then verifies, rewrites, or
deletes it in the same turn.

Nothing in memory needs your approval, and nothing you asked for goes
there. Memory is what the agent learned by itself; documents you review
stay in `docs/`.

## Why another memory system?

Claude Code's own memory lives in a directory under your home, outside the
repository. It is per machine and per user, git never carries it, and it
loads its index into every session. That is the right place for facts about
the machine and about you: which host this is, where the tools are
installed, how you like to be spoken to.

This plugin is for what the agent learns about the project: a quirk of a
tool, a procedure that worked, a finding about the domain, a decision and
its reason. That knowledge belongs with the code, in git, so it reaches
every clone and can be diffed, reviewed, and rolled back like anything
else in the repository. It is found by search rather than loaded whole, so
it stays cheap as it grows. And it cites files at a commit, which is what
lets a page be marked suspect when the thing it describes changes. Age
alone is only a hint.

| Belongs in | Examples |
|---|---|
| Claude Code's memory | this machine's hostname, local paths, your tone preference, a fact true only here |
| `.memory/` (this plugin) | the tool that fails to install on macOS and the fix, the port a service listens on and why, the trust model you chose |
| `docs/` | anything you asked for or reviewed: designs, research, decisions with their reasoning |

A memory page may cite a document in `docs/`. A document never cites
memory.

## Status

Experimental. In daily use on two repositories since 2026-09-05. The page
format is fixed; the wrapper's commands and hooks may change between
pinned commits.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code 2.1.195 or later, on macOS or Linux
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) on PATH
- [ollama](https://ollama.com) with the `nomic-embed-text` model, on this
  machine or on a host you can reach. Without it, a string-search fallback
  still works, and finds identifiers but not paraphrase.
- A git repository. Memory only persists if `.memory/` is committed.

## Installation

Once per machine, in Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add daftdoki/dokidlc-plugins
claude plugin install memory@dokidlc
```

Then open a session in a repository and say "set up memory". The agent
asks whether you want semantic search or the string fallback, and where
the embedding model runs. It then runs `memory setup`, `memory init`, and
`memory doctor --fix`, which installs memoryfield-tool at the pinned
commit and, for a local model on macOS, ollama and the model. You commit
what it staged. [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) has every step as a command you
run yourself, for a bootstrap script or a container.

## Usage

Mostly you do nothing. Each session starts with one line:

```
memory: 59 pages, semantic via 127.0.0.1:11434. Topics: claude-code 20, questlog 17, decisions 9, plugin 8. 3 suspect: diff-pass-with-old-value-grep-finds-the-missed-copy.md, ... (cited file changed).
```

Ask a question and the agent searches. "Do you remember anything about
installing this on a mac?" runs:

```
$ memory search "why does install fail on a mac"
pysqlite3-install-override.md: Why memoryfield-tool needs a uv overrides file on macOS and arm64 Linux (distance 0.366; via semantic, install, mac)
project-settings-do-not-install-plugins.md: Since 2.1.195 settings only enable plugins; each machine runs claude plugin install once ... (distance 0.409; via semantic, install, fail, mac)
```

Each line says how the page was found. "Remember that the NAS keeps its
live firmware in /etc/default_config" makes the agent write a page with a
title, a one-line summary, topics, a kind, and a Sources section. "What in
memory might be out of date?" runs `memory doubt`. The full command list
is in `memory --help`; the rules the agent follows are in
[skills/memory/SKILL.md](skills/memory/SKILL.md).

## Caveats

- The hooks fail open. A dead embedding host is skipped after a two-second
  probe, and a search that cannot run prints nothing.
- The semantic index lives in the machine's cache directory, not the
  repository. A fresh clone rebuilds it on first use.
- A check command that arrived with a clone runs only after the agent asks
  you and runs `memory approve`. Until then `doubt` lists it and `verify`
  refuses the page.
- URLs in a page's refs are contacted only by `memory doubt --network`,
  which asks you first.
- Past fifty pages the session-start line says to merge or delete before
  writing more. Search stays cheap as the field grows; near-duplicate
  pages make it name the wrong one.
- The plugin has to be installed once per machine. `.claude/settings.json`
  can enable it for every clone, but cannot install it.

## Configuration

Your setup choices live in `~/.config/dokidlc-memory/config.toml`; say so
and the agent runs `memory setup` again. An `OLLAMA_HOST` exported in the
shell turns semantic search on and overrides the host. To enable the
plugin for everyone who clones the repository, add the marketplace and
the plugin to `.claude/settings.json` by hand; [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)
shows the two keys.

## Built on memoryfields

The idea, the page format, and the search engine are Cal Paterson's: the
[article](https://calpaterson.com/memoryfields.html), the [format
specification](https://github.com/calpaterson/memoryfield-spec) (MIT),
[memoryfield-tool](https://github.com/calpaterson/memoryfield-tool)
(AGPL-3.0-or-later), and [his skill for
agents](https://github.com/calpaterson/memoryfield-skill) (MIT). The tool
is installed as published at the commit in `memory.pin`; nothing from it is
copied here.
